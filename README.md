# PHISHING DETECTION CAPSTONE PROJECT

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project focuses on detecting phishing websites using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately distinguish between legitimate and phishing websites based on various features. The project is implemented in Python using popular libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

# DATASET
The dataset consists of features extracted from websites, including domain-related attributes, URL-based features, and content-based indicators. The data is preprocessed and used to train various machine learning models to classify websites as phishing or legitimate.

# FEATURES
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming data for model training.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and feature correlations.

Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features for better classification performance.

Model Training: Implementing machine learning models like Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression.

Evaluation Metrics: Analyzing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# RESULTS
The trained model achieves high accuracy in detecting phishing websites.

Feature importance analysis reveals key indicators of phishing sites.

Comparative analysis of models to determine the best-performing classifier.

# FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
Implement deep learning approaches for improved accuracy.

Deploy the model as a web application for real-time phishing detection.

Integrate additional features for better classification.
